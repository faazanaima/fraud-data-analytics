# Fraud Data Analytics : Gambling Transaction Detection Case Study

Background: Recently, there has been a significant surge in online gambling transactions in Indonesia through E-Money services and digital wallets. Payment service providers are required to report and block these transactions to comply with regulations and avoid the risk of fines and reputational damage. You will be given access to a financial transaction dataset with masked personal information (PII) to analyze indications of these suspicious financial transactions.

Objective: Analyze the transaction dataset to identify patterns of online gambling transactions and distinguish them from other types of transactions.

This study examines online gambling transactions in Indonesia using anonymized financial data and a soft voting ensemble learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest). The model achieved 90% accuracy distinguishing gambling from normal transactions, supporting monitoring and risk mitigation.
